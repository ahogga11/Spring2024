Robot Arm Model:
My first concept was to have the robot arm display jewelery and to hold on to them while they are not being worn. Then, I took inspiration from my own day-to-day life and created a robot arm that would help with the gruelling process of taming bed-head: The Hair Dresser. The robot arm was designed with the idea to minimize the amount of time spent trying to fix a bad hair day, as well as creating the perfect hairstyle every day. The robot arm has smooth synthetic skin to avoid tangling hair in the mechanical joints and to give a more friendly appearance.  
Whilst modeling the robot arm in Maya, I struggled with making the hair tie, and ended up deciding to go for a scrunchie kind of vibe. I also ended up making the fingers look more slim than in the sketches, which helps with the impression of the arm being a machine.


Whale Model:
Whilst modeling the whale in ZBrush, I discovered an issue where the program wasn't mirroring what I was drawing onto my project. After playing around, I eventually had to manually add the eyes, side fins, and tail fins. I also tried to build onto the mouth of the whale, but ran into an issue where the clay won't build ontop of each other any more, so the mouth is currently a little bit small. It took me a little bit of time to figure out how to export the model from ZBrush over to Maya, but one of my classmates helped by informing me about GoZ, which exports files directly from ZBrush over to Maya.

After playing around with the model more in ZBrush, I managed to finish the mouth and attempted to make the whale's bristle teeth, but haven't figured out how to get the right texture yet. I exported the model over to Maya and added joints to it, which wasn't too difficult up until it was time to orient them. I'm still getting used to how the Joint Orientation Window works, however, I now understand which way the axes are meant to be rotated, which helped the process significantly!
