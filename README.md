Robot Arm Model:
My first concept was to have the robot arm display jewelery and to hold on to them while they are not being worn. Then, I took inspiration from my own day-to-day life and created a robot arm that would help with the gruelling process of taming bed-head: The Hair Dresser. The robot arm was designed with the idea to minimize the amount of time spent trying to fix a bad hair day, as well as creating the perfect hairstyle every day. The robot arm has smooth synthetic skin to avoid tangling hair in the mechanical joints and to give a more friendly appearance.
